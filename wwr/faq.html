                <h1>FREQUENTLY <br> ASKED <br> QUESTIONS</h1>
            </div>
        <div class="faquestions">
                <h1>&nbsp; Do I need any prior experience?</h1>
                <h3>&nbsp; No prior experience is necessary! Our trained guides are here to ensure your safety and enjoyment throughout the adventure. Even if you can't swim, rest assured that we provide lifejackets for everyone, regardless of shape or size. However, it is recommended that participants can swim in the water. Our guides are well-prepared to handle all skill levels and will give you all the instructions and support you need to have a great time.</h3>
                <h1>&nbsp;What should I bring with me?</h1>
                <h3>&nbsp; It's recommended that you bring a change of clothes and a towel, as YOU WILL get wet during the trip. Also, consider bringing any personal items you might need to stay comfortable, such as sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and a waterproof bag for your belongings. We will provide all the necessary rafting equipment, including helmets, life jackets, and paddles. Don't forget to wear appropriate footwear like water shoes or sandals with straps, as flip-flops can easily be lost in the water.</h3> 
                <h1>&nbsp; Is there any group/family discounts? </h1>
                <h3>&nbsp; Absolutely! We offer group and family discounts to make your adventure more affordable. Depending on the size of your group, you can receive a discount ranging from 15% to 30%. Larger groups typically qualify for higher discounts. For specific details and to discuss your group's needs, please contact us directly.</h3>
                <h1>&nbsp; How long will does the trip take?</h1>
                <h3>&nbsp; Our rafting trips start bright and early at 8 AM, and we usually finish around 4 to 5 PM. The duration can vary slightly depending on how long we stop at various fun waypoints along the way, where you can enjoy swimming, exploring, or just relaxing. Lunch will be provided as well as snacks throughout the journey. Please let us know of any dietary restrictions prior so we can make sure everybody has something to eat.</h3>
